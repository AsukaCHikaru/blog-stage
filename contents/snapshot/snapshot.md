Embed note heading in Obsidian.md does not show the note's title, and I'm annoyed by it so much that I decided to build a plugin for it. How hard could it be?

Finally realized that [DisplayFusion](https://www.displayfusion.com/) doesn't work well with windows 10 task view feature, at lease on my machine. Task view has always been a pain in the butt for me, every time I (unintentionally) activate it the desktop freezes. I thought it was windows build quality, turns out it was a compatibility issue. Now I get to utilize the task view feature, hope it helps my productivity.

Started trying photography. After walking around carrying a camera for a day, I found that trying to take photos made me paying more attention to my surroundings.
